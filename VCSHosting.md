# Advanced GitHub Features

## 1. GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
GitHub Actions is a powerful tool for automating workflows, such as building, testing, and deploying projects.

### Example Workflow for Testing:
```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```
You can explore thousands of pre-built Actions in the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace).
