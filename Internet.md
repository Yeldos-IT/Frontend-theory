### **How the Internet Works**

**DNS (Domain Name System):**
Translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses that computers understand.
How it works: The browser asks the DNS server for the IP address, then connects to it. This is like looking up a friend's phone number in a directory and calling them.

**HTTP and HTTPS:**
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): The protocol for transferring data between a browser and a server.
HTTPS: The same, but with encryption for security. Data is encrypted so no one can intercept sensitive information like passwords.
Request structure: The client (browser) sends a request to the server, and the server responds (e.g., with an HTML page).

**IP Addresses and Domains:**
An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
Domains are human-readable names for IP addresses (e.g., example.com).

**Servers and Hosting:**
Servers store website data and respond to client requests.
Hosting is a service that provides servers for storing websites.
